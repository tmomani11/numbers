# README for Numbers Script

## Program Description
This script prompts the user to enter a positive integer and then prints all integers from **1** up to and including that number. Each number is labeled as **“Odd”** or **“Even.”**  
It demonstrates conditional logic, arithmetic evaluation, and iteration using a `for` loop in Bash.  

## Example Output
If the user enters **5**, the program should display:
```
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
4 Even
5 Odd
```

## Usage
To run the script interactively:
```bash
./numbers.sh
```

To test with an input file (for example, `numbers-input`):
```bash
./numbers.sh < numbers-input
```

## How the Script Works
1. The script begins with a **shebang** (`#!/bin/bash`) and identifying comments.  
2. It **prompts** the user for a positive integer using `read`.  
3. A **for loop** iterates from `1` to the user’s number.  
4. The **modulus operator (`%`)** determines whether the number is odd or even.  
5. For each number, an `if` statement prints the number followed by either “Odd” or “Even.”  

## Core Logic Example
```bash
for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))
do
  if (( i % 2 == 0 ))
  then
    echo "$i Even"
  else
    echo "$i Odd"
  fi
done
```

## Testing Results
When tested with the input file `numbers-input` containing:
```
5
```
The script outputs:
```
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
4 Even
5 Odd
```

You should also verify:
- That negative or zero inputs are handled gracefully (optional).  
- That input `10` produces alternating Odd/Even lines up to 10.  

## Example Validations
| Input | Output Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| 3 | 1 Odd  2 Even  3 Odd |
| 7 | 1 Odd  2 Even  3 Odd  4 Even  5 Odd  6 Even  7 Odd |
